Don't tailgate - Maintain at least a 3 second gap between you and the vehicle in front of you. And if you're on a busy expressway or driving in bad conditions, increase that time to 5 seconds</div></li><li><div style="text-align:left;">Give notice - Let other drivers know what your plan is by signaling to turn or tapping your brake lights to stop</div></li><li><div style="text-align:left;">Brakes - Use your brakes smoothly by applying gradual pressure. If you ride your brakes, other drivers behind you will also slow down and eventually may not pay attention to your actual intent. It is similar to the concept of the "boy who cried wolf." When you really do stop, you may be rear-ended</div></li><li><div style="text-align:left;">Keep pace - Keep pace with traffic around you, but do not go over the posted speed limit</div></li><li><div style="text-align:left;">Check your rear-view mirror - Check behind you constantly. Be aware of the proximity of the vehicle behind you</div></li><li><div style="text-align:left;">Changing lanes - Before changing lanes, make sure the lane you are moving into is clear. Also, make sure your speed is sufficient enough so that pulling in front of another car does not cause that vehicle to brake to avoid hitting you</div></li><li><div style="text-align:left;">Keep your foot on brake pedal - After stopping, continue to keep your foot pressed on the brake pedal to alert others that you are stopped</div></li><li><div style="text-align:left;">Keep rear lights clean and in working order - Maintain the working order of your brake lights and keep them clean</div></li></ul></div></div>
