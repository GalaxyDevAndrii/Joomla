However, even though nighttime is the most dangerous time to drive, the most difficult lighting exists at dusk. The difficulty begins at twilight, the period between sunset and total darkness. During twilight, the sky is still bright; but at ground level, it becomes progressively darker.</div></li><li><div style="text-align:left;">The onset of total darkness changes the driving situation again, because now the eyes are adjusted to the darkness. The ability to see ahead has increased. But your peripheral vision, that is, your vision from either side, is almost non-existent.</div></li></ul></div></div>
