These restrictions may be only imposed during <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_hour">peak travel times</a> or may apply at all times. According to the criteria used there are different types of lanes: temporary or permanent with concrete barriers; two-directional or reversible; and exclusive, concurrent or contraflow lanes working in peak periods.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-occupancy_vehicle_lane">[1]</a> The normal minimum occupancy level is 2 or 3 occupants. Many jurisdictions exempt other vehicles, including motorcycles, charter buses, emergency and law enforcement vehicles, low-emission and other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_vehicle">green vehicles</a>, and/or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-occupancy_toll_lane">single-occupancy vehicles paying a toll</a>. HOV lanes are normally created to increase average vehicle occupancy and persons traveling with the goal of reducing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traffic_congestion">traffic congestion</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_pollution">air pollution</a>,<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-occupancy_vehicle_lane">[2]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-occupancy_vehicle_lane">[3]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-occupancy_vehicle_lane">[4]</a> although their effectiveness is questionable.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-occupancy_vehicle_lane">[5]</a><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-occupancy_vehicle_lane">[6]</a></p><p style="text-align:left;">Regional and corporate-sponsored vanpools, carpools, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carpool">rideshare</a> communities give commuters a way to increase occupancy. For places without such services, online rideshare communities can serve a similar purpose.[<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed">citation needed</a>] <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slugging">Slugging lines</a> are common in some places, where solo drivers pick up a passenger to share the ride and allow them to use the HOV lane. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-occupancy_toll_lane">High-occupancy toll lanes</a> (HOT lanes), which allow solo driver vehicles to use HOV lanes on payment of a fee which varies depending on demand, have also been introduced in the United States and Canada.</p></div></div>
