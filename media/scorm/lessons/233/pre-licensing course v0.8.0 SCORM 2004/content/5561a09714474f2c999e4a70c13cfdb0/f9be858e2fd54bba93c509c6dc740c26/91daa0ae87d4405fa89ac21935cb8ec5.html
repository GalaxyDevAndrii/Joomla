Scan carefully for bicycles and mopeds before proceeding through an intersection, giving them the same consideration you would any other vehicle.• Bicycles are often overlooked by motorists.•It is not always easy to judge the speed or distance of a bicycle.•Crashes with wrong-way bicyclists frequently occur when a motorist wants to turn right onto a main road and is only looking left for approaching traffic. Be sure to look right and check for wrong-way bicyclists on the road or sidewalk before proceeding.•On residential streets, especially those with parked cars, travel at or below the speed limit.59SHARING THE ROAD WITH MOPEDS AND BICYCLES</p><p style="text-align:left;">60•If you are following a bicyclist and need to make a right turn, slow down and remain behind the cyclist until you are able to turn.•Cyclists often travel at surprisingly fast speeds. If you need to make a left turn, yield to oncoming bicyclists unless you are absolutely sure you can make the turn before the cyclist reaches the intersection. •Bicyclists change speed and lane position when encountering bad road conditions, such as manhole covers, diagonal railroad tracks, drain grates, road debris, or in strong winds. Be ready to react.•When you are passing, give bicycles and mopeds a full lane width. Do not squeeze past these road users. The bicycle is generally a slower moving vehicle and this may require you to slow down. Wait for a clear stretch of road before passing a cyclist in a lane too narrow to share.•Check for passing bicyclists before opening your car door into a traffic lane or bicycle lane.•A bicycle lane is a portion of a roadway designated by striping to be usedby bicycles. You may cross a bicycle lane when turning or when entering or leaving the roadway. You must yield to bicyclists in a bicycle lane.WHERE TO RIDE MOPEDS AND BICYCLESOn public streets and highways, you have the same rights and responsibilitiesas a motor vehicle operator. Always ride with traffic, never against it. When operating at less than the posted speed or traffic flow, generally ride as near to the right side of the roadway as is safe. The right edge of the road often has hazards like ditches, gutters, sand, and gravel shoulders. Leave space between yourself and these hazards as needed for safety.You may move more toward the middle or left of the lane or roadway, as appropriate: • when making a left turn;• when avoiding hazards;• when the lane is too narrow to share with another vehicle; and• when there is a right-turn-only lane and you are going straight.Always check traffic and signal before changing lanes or changing your position within a lane. On a one-way street, bicyclists may also choose to ride as far left as is safe.The law does not allow you to ride a moped on any part of the federal interstate highway system. SAFETY TIPS FOR MOPED AND BICYCLE RIDERS1.State law does not require you to wear a helmet. However, wearing a safety-certified helmet can prevent serious head injuries or death.2.Be sure your bike is in safe condition and has all the equipment required by law.3.Make sure motorists see you. Wear bright colored clothes and stay out of a vehicle’s blind spots. Use proper lights and reflectors when riding after dark.</p><p style="text-align:left;">614.Make sure you signal before you slow down, change lanes, or turn. Before merging, changing lanes, or turning, scan behind and in front to ensure that it is safe to make this maneuver. Do so in plenty of time and in cooperation with other drivers who will be affected by your move. If it is not safe, continue on a straight course and scan repeatedly and only move once it is safe. In conditions of heavy traffic, less proficient bicyclists may find it easier to wait near the curb for a safe gap to appear.5.Be careful when passing to the left of a parked or moving vehicle. You should leave 3 to 4 feet of clearance to avoid suddenly opened car doors or to allow for a vehicle to swerve.6.Be extra careful at intersections. Do not assume your right-of-way when there is a vehicle approaching. Be aware that motor vehicle drivers may not see you approaching the intersection, or may believe that you are moving at a slower speed than you are.7.Keep a steady line and be predictable as a courtesy to other traffic and to increase your personal safety.8.For teen and adult bicyclists, studies show that riding on the street with traffic, not against it (following the same traffic rules that other vehicles do), is far safer than riding on the sidewalk.</p></div></div>
