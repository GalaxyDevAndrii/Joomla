Be ready to react.</p><p style="text-align:left;">•You should not share a lane with a motorcycle. The motorcyclist needs the entire lane for safety reasons.</p><p style="text-align:left;">•When you are passing, give motorcycles a full lane width. Do not squeeze past these road users. Wait for a clear stretch of road before passing a cyclist in a lane too narrow to share.</p><h2 style="text-align:left;">SAFETY TIPS FOR MOTORCYCLE RIDERS</h2><p style="text-align:left;">1.The law requires you to wear a helmet. Wearing a safety-certified helmet can prevent serious head injuries or death.</p><p style="text-align:left;">2.Be sure your motorcycle is in safe condition and has all the equipment required by law.</p><p style="text-align:left;">3.Make sure motorists see you. Wear bright colored clothes and stay out of a vehicle’s blind spots. Use proper lights and reflectors when riding after dark.</p><p style="text-align:left;">4.Make sure you signal before you slow down, change lanes or turn. Before merging, changing lanes, or turning, scan behind and in front to ensure that it is safe to make this maneuver. Do so in plenty of time and in cooperation with other drivers who will be affected by your move. If it is not safe, continue on a straight course and scan repeatedly. Only move once it is safe.</p><p style="text-align:left;">5.Be careful when passing to the left of a parked or moving vehicle. You should leave 3 to 4 feet of clearance to avoid suddenly opened car doors or to allow for a vehicle to swerve.</p><p style="text-align:left;">6.Be extra careful at intersections. Do not assume your right-of-way when there is a vehicle approaching. Be aware that motor vehicle drivers may not see you approaching the intersection, or may believe that you are moving at a slower speed than you are.7.Keep a steady line and be predictable as a courtesy to other traffic and to increase your personal safety</p></div></div>
