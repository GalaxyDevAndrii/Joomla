As a pedestrian, you should know your rights and responsibilities, and as a driver you should know the law when pedestrians are around.AS A PEDESTRIAN, YOU SHOULD KNOW . . .When you are facing a “WALK” signal or a green light, you have the right-of-way. You may begin to cross the road after you make sure all drivers see you and stop for you.Do not begin to cross the street when you are facing a “DON’T WALK” signal or a red or yellow light. If the flashing “DON’T WALK” sign appearswhen you are crossing the street, you may finish crossing the street.You should cross the road at an intersection or a crosswalk when:• You are in a business district.•You are between two closely spaced intersections with traffic lights.Otherwise, you may cross the road in the middle of the block without a crosswalk being careful when stepping out between two parked vehicles. You must yield the right-of-way to all traffic when crossing in the middle of a block. Walk facing traffic when no sidewalk is available.You should not stand in a traffic lane to speak to a driver for any length of time, as this could cause an crash. Instead, you should wait for the driver to pull over to a safe parking spot, and you should remain on the curb side of the vehicle.58SHARING THE ROAD WITH PEDESTRIANS</p><p style="text-align:left;">AS A DRIVER, YOU SHOULD KNOW . . .In some situations, pedestrians are required by law to yield to vehicles. In other situations, vehicles are required to yield to pedestrians. In all situations, whether the pedestrians are obeying the law or not, you must drive carefully, reduce your speed if needed, and do your best to avoid endangering pedestrians.Even when you are facing a green light you must yield the right-of-way to all pedestrians in the intersection. Never assume you have the right-of-way. Do not assume pedestrians see you and will stop for you.Do not pass a vehicle that has stopped or slowed down for a pedestrian.Watch out for kids. Children will run out into the road without looking for traffic. So, be extra careful when you drive near schools, playgrounds, parks, or in residential areas. You must obey a slower speed limit in a school zone when lights are flashing or children are present. At a school crossing where there is a traffic patrol, stop and yield if a traffic patrol member signals you to do so.The following laws or rules also apply:•Drivers must always yield the right-of-way to persons who are blind. When a pedestrian is crossing a street or highway guided by a dog or carrying a white cane (or a white cane with a red tip), vehicles must come to a complete stop.•Drivers must yield when a pedestrian is in a marked or unmarked crosswalk on or approaching their side of the road. •As you prepare for a right turn, especially on a red traffic signal, be cautious of pedestrians (or bicyclists) approaching on your right. •Drivers should not block the crosswalk when stopped at a red traffic signal. Drivers should not cross a sidewalk or crosswalk without first yielding to pedestrians.</p><p>dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.</p></div></div>
