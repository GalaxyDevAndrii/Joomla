Studies have shown that if you use seat belts, your chances of being hurt or killed in a traffic crash are greatly reduced.Seat belts should always be worn with the lap belt low and snug across the hips and the shoulder belt across the chest. Shoulder belts should never be placed under the arm or behind the back. If your vehicle has a two-part seat belt system, be sure to wear both the lap and shoulder belt.Seat belts should be worn even if your vehicle is equipped with air bags. While air bags are good protection against hitting the steering wheel, dashboard, or windshield, they do not protect you if you are hit from the side or rear, or if the vehicle rolls over. An air bag will not keep you behind the wheel in these situations. An unrestrained or improperly restrained occupant can be seriously injured or killed by a deploying air bag. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration recommends drivers sit with at least 10 inches between the center of their breastbone and the center of the steering wheel. Children 12 and under should always ride properly restrained in a rear seat. Never put a rear-facing infant restraint in the front seat of a vehicle with a front passenger air bag.If you need more information about child seat safety, contact: Department of Transportation, Highway Safety Division, web site: www.modot.gov; phone: (800) 800-BELT.SEAT BELTS — IT’S THE LAWMissouri law requires the operator and front seat occupants of all passenger vehicles to wear a properly adjusted and fastened seat belt.
