And the force of impact at 30 mph is nine times greater than at 10 mph.</div></li><li><div class="O1" style="text-align:left;">Weight of the car: The heavier a car is, the harder it will hit any other object.</div></li><li><div class="O1" style="text-align:left;">Impact distance: The force of impact also depends on the distance a moving vehicle travels between first impact with an object and the point where the vehicle comes to a full stop. When a car hits an unmoving solid object, the impact distance is short. The object does not "cave in" at impact, and so kinetic energy is spent immediately on impact. The shorter the impact distance, the greater the damage.</div></li><li><div style="text-align:left;">Reducing the Force of Impact</div></li><li><div class="O1" style="text-align:left;">Many newer model cars have features that help increase impact distance by absorbing the energy. These features include airbags; crumple zones; automatic seat belts; head restraints; energy absorbing bumpers, steering columns, and wheels; padded dashboards; safety glass windshields; and reinforced sides.</div></li><li style="text-align:left;">Hitting your head at 15 mph has the same force of impact as being hit with a sledge hammer. The same amount of force!</li><li><div class="O1" style="text-align:left;">At 30 mph, it's like your head is being shot out of a cannon. A cannonball goes 30 mph when it's first fired. Your head weighs almost as much as a cannonball. So, it's like your head is being shot out of a cannon right into your dashboard. (Kind of like a circus performance with a really bad ending</div></li><li style="text-align:left;">You're 25 times more likely to be killed if you are thrown from your car than in a plane crash!</li></ul></div></div>
