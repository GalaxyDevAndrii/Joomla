If you are arrested for an alcohol or drug-related violation, the police officer will likely request that you submit to a chemical test. Under New York's "Implied Consent" law, when you drive a car in this state you are considered to have already given your consent to take this type of test.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Chemical test refusal is a separate issue from whether you were guilty of an alcohol or drug-related violation. If you refuse to take the test after being arrested, your driver license will be suspended when you are arraigned in court on the alcohol or other drug-related charge. In addition, the fact that you refused a chemical test can be brought up in court when you are tried on the alcohol or drug-related charge. If a DMV hearing later confirms you refused the test, your driver license will be revoked even if you are found not guilty of the alcohol or other drug-related violation.
