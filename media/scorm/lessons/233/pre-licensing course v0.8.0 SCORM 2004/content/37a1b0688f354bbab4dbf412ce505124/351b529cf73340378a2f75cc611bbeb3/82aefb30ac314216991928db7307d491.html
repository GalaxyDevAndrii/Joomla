Under the state's "zero tolerance" law, it is a violation for a person under 21 to drive with any BAC that can be measured (.02 to .07). After a finding of violation is determined at a DMV hearing, the driver license will be suspended for six months. The driver then must pay a $100 suspension termination fee and a $125 civil penalty to be re-licensed. For a second Zero Tolerance violation, the driver license will be revoked for at least one year or until the driver reaches 21, whichever is longer.</p></div></div>
