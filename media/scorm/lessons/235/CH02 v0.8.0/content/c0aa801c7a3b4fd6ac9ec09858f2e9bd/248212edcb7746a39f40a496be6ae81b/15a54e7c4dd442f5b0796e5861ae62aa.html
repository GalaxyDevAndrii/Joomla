This is because you cannot see as well when you drive in reverse. This is true even if you have rear-view camera.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Your vehicle is also harder to control when you drive in reverse.</p><p style="text-align:left;">Therefore, you should do as little backing as possible in your everyday driving.</p><p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Check behind your vehicle.</strong></p><p style="text-align:left;">Before you get behind the wheel and start driving, you should walk behind your vehicle&lt; and make sure the area behind your vehicle is clear. Be extra careful if children are playing nearby. If they are behind your vehicle, you may not see them from your driver seat.</p><p style="text-align:left;"><strong>Adjust your mirrors.</strong></p><p style="text-align:left;">Then, before starting the engine, make sure you have adjusted your side and rear-view mirrors.</p><p style="text-align:left;">This is something you should always do before you drive off. Not only when you must drive in reverse.</p><p style="text-align:left;">It is important to remember that even if your mirrors are well-adjusted, you should not rely solely on mirrors when backing up.</p></div></div>
